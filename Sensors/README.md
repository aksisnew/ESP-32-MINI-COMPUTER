# Target

-> Adding sensors like

- multimeter
- temperature sensor
- fans for temprature emulation
- sensors for how much power is being drawen

## SENSORS TO BE ADDED

-> basic custom made multimeter sensor.
-> smoke sensor for sensing any circuit failure causing slight smokes.
-> temprature sensor for being able to sense what components are generating more heat.
