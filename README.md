# ESP-32-MINI-COMPUTER
Hi ! hello ! Bonjour! , I'm making a esp 32 based mini computer that can handel things like multimeter input,temperature,fans and etc for my electronic test bench, where i build electronic projects with  esp,adruino or raspberry pi based projects. This repository is in development currently and is not fully built so you will find empty files.

## Aims with this project

- To be able to control output and show output from multimeter, temperature sensors, smoke detectors and various other sensors I will be adding.
- Being able to have a mini display the esp is connected to, being able to see output on other devices on local network, and also have a  custom keyboard.

## MICRO CONTROLER USING

- 2 esp 32 s3
- 1 esp 32

## Other hardwares
- A 3.5 inch screen for showing output
- A heatsink and fan with smart temprature probe for the main mcu to check when it needs cooling
